# C++ Module Learning Journey
## Introduction
This repository contains my work for the C++ module at 42. Throughout the module, I explored a variety of concepts fundamental to mastering object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++, including polymorphism, canonical form, templates, containers, and more. This README outlines my learning journey and provides a summary of the key concepts Iâ€™ve worked on.

## Key Concepts Learned
__1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Polymorphism__
Polymorphism is a core concept in OOP that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while enabling specialized behavior in derived classes. During the exercises, I implemented polymorphic behavior using:

Virtual functions for runtime polymorphism

Abstract classes and pure virtual functions to define interfaces

Inheritance to create class hierarchies

__2. Canonical Form__
The canonical form of a C++ class defines a proper set of constructors and destructors that manage memory and ensure correct object behavior. I learned to implement:

The default constructor: Initializes objects with default values.

The copy constructor: Handles the creation of new objects from existing ones.

The assignment operator: Ensures proper copying when assigning one object to another.

The destructor: Properly cleans up resources when an object is destroyed.

The implementation of these functions ensures proper management of dynamic memory and avoids memory leaks.

__3. Templates__
Templates in C++ allow writing generic and reusable code. I worked on:

Function templates: Allowing functions to operate with different data types.

Class templates: Enabling the creation of generic classes for containers or algorithms.

Template specialization: Customizing template behavior for specific types.

Templates help in writing more flexible and efficient code while reducing repetition.

__4. Containers__
C++ Standard Library containers are essential for storing and manipulating collections of data. I learned to use:

Vectors for dynamic arrays.

Lists for doubly linked lists.

Maps and Sets for storing key-value pairs and unique elements.

Iterators to traverse containers efficiently.

These containers provide important features like automatic resizing, ordering, and easy data manipulation.

## Conclusion
This module helped me gain a solid understanding of key C++ concepts like polymorphism, canonical form, templates, and containers. Each exercise pushed me to apply these concepts in practical ways, deepening my understanding of object-oriented programming and modern C++ practices. I look forward to continuing to build on these skills in future projects.
